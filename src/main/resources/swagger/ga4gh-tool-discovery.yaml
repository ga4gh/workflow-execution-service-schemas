  title: GA4GH Workflow Execution API
  description: 'Proposed API for GA4GH workflow execution. A workflow is defined with a given format (currently CWL or WDL) and can encompass a single tool execution or a complex DAG of individual tool calls. The parameterization of the workflow called will follow the schema proposed in this group as a common format used for WDL and CWL execution'
